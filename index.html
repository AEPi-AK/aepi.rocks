          First and foremost, our chapter is a group of friends; we live together, eat together, work together, and hang out together. We are men who seek to enhance our college experience — complementing our academic pursuits by providing a fun and supportive environment that allows us to thoroughly enjoy everything that Carnegie Mellon and the City of Pittsburgh have to offer. 
          Whether it’s going to the gym, playing sports, going to see a movie, doing homework together, or even just lending a helping hand to one another, we are always there for each other. We are friends, and we are brothers.
